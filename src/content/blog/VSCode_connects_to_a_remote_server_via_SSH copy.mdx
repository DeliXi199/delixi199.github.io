## Preface

VSCode is an excellent code editor, and using it to connect to a server is also a great choice. This article will introduce how to connect to a remote server using VSCode and enable password-free login by setting up mutual trust between nodes.
## Main text

### Install VSCode Plugin

First, you must have [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) installed on your computer.  
Then, you can download the **Remote-SSH** plugin from the extensions panel.

After installation, a remote connection icon will appear on the left sidebar.

 Click on the SSH settings icon to open the `config` file and configure it as follows:


```config
Host Supercomputer_cluster
    HostName 159.226.208.68
    User yihaoxu
    Port 61288
```
- The name after `Host` can be anything you choose.  
- The value after `HostName` should be your server's IP address.  
- The value after `User` should be your username.  
- The value after `Port` should be your server's port number.  


Click the connection arrow to start connecting, then enter your account password to log in to the server.

### Set up password-free login

- Run the `ssh-keygen -t rsa` command on both your local computer and the server, pressing Enter to accept all defaults.

In your local computerâ€™s `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh` directory, two files will be generated: `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key).

- Copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` and paste them into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the server.

After this setup, you can access the server using VSCode without entering a password.

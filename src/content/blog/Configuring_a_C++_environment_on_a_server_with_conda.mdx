## Preface

On a research group's computing cluster, system-wide versions of C++ and MPI are often outdated for the sake of stability. 
This can cause compatibility issues during development.

While Conda is typically used for Python environments, it is also highly effective for configuring custom C++ environments, 
including specific versions of MPI and OpenMP.

## Main Content

### Creating the Conda Environment

Assuming Anaconda is already installed, run the following commands to create a new virtual environment with updated GCC and CMake:

```bash
conda create -n mpi_env gxx_linux-64=12.1.0 gcc_linux-64=12.1.0 cmake make -c conda-forge
conda activate mpi_env
```

Check if the compilers are correctly configured:

```bash
which gcc
which g++
```

Then, install MPI:

```bash
conda install mpich -c conda-forge
```

The `mpich` package includes the MPI libraries and essential tools like `mpicc`, `mpicxx`, and `mpirun` for compiling and running parallel programs.

> ⚠️ However, the system's default `mpicxx` may still take precedence over the Conda-installed version. To ensure Conda's version is prioritized when the environment is activated, run:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$CONDA_PREFIX/bin:$PATH"' >> $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/force_conda_path.sh
```

Then, reactivate the environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
conda activate mpi_env
```

Verify the updated MPI toolchain:

```bash
which mpicxx
mpicxx -show
```

Now, you can install any additional C++ packages you need, such as Google Test:

```bash
conda install gtest -c conda-forge
```

To compile your C++ program:

```bash
mpicxx -std=c++11 -O2 -o mpi_demo mpi_demo.cpp
```

> ⚠️ Important: Conda's version of `libstdc++.so.6` may conflict with the system MPI or UCX libraries. Therefore, it's recommended **not to use `srun` to submit jobs**, but instead use the `mpirun` provided by Conda’s `mpich` package. This ensures all processes use only the libraries inside the Conda environment.

### Example SLURM Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=hmt03
#SBATCH --job-name=mpi_demo
#SBATCH --partition=regular6430
#SBATCH --nodes=2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --output=slurm-%j.out
#SBATCH --error=slurm-%j.err
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00    # ✅ Optional: set a max run time

# ✅ Initialize Conda for shell usage
source ~/Python/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

# ✅ Activate the desired environment
conda activate ALB_basis

# ✅ Force usage of libraries inside Conda
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# ✅ Disable UCX and InfiniBand to avoid UCX-related errors
export UCX_TLS=^all
export OMPI_MCA_btl=^openib

# ✅ Use Conda's version of mpirun
$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/mpirun -n 2 ./mpi_demo
```

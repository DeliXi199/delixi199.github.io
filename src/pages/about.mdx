# About Me

---

## Brief introduction

I come from Shangrao, Jiangxi Province, China, and earned my bachelor's degree from Wuhan University. 
Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
I have always been deeply passionate about physics.

During my undergraduate studies, I was introduced to programming, and it sparked a fascination with computer science as well. 
This eventually led me to choose computational physics as my research field.

At the moment, I am uncertain whether I am truly suited for research. However, 
I hope to use the five years of my Ph.D. journey to explore what aligns with my interests and strengths. 
I enjoy learning new and exciting things, which makes me believe that research could be a suitable path for me.

As for my current abilities, I am still in the process of discovering my potential. 
That said, I am determined to work hard and strive for growth in my chosen field.

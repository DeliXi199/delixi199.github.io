# Introduction

## Welcome to DeliXi's website!

### My Research Interests

Currently, Iâ€™m still in the learning phase, so Iâ€™m curious about almost everythingâ€”haha!

### Why Did I Create This Website?

As a graduate student specializing in computational physics, I frequently work with computers. 
Creating a personal website allows me to showcase myself conveniently, much like a programmer would. 
For instance, I can display my personal profile, achievements, research outcomes, and project experiences all in this website.

Additionally, this website serves as a space for documenting my life and organizing scattered pieces of knowledge. 
During the learning process, I often encounter fragmented bits of information that are easy to forget without proper documentation. 
Writing blogs helps me consolidate and structure my knowledge for future reference and enables me to share it with others.

Traditional blogs often have a limited format and lack variety in content. 
Thatâ€™s why I decided to build a website that is more dynamic and visually appealing.

### How Did I Build This Website?

Honestly, I didnâ€™t have the ability to independently create such an aesthetically pleasing website. 
I found inspiration from a video by Bilibili content creator [EveSunMaple](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QM4m1276h/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_history.content.click&vd_source=0c079d72c13711458c897806ea7f0874), 
where he demonstrated how to build a blog site using Astro. I was impressed by the elegance of his design, 
so I used his website as a reference, making some simple modifications to create my own version. 
Iâ€™d like to express my deepest gratitude to him for his amazing work!

Lastly, hereâ€™s the link to his fantastic project on GitHub: [Frosti](https://github.com/EveSunMaple/Frosti).
